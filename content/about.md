Hi, my name is Harry Duong, and I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto. 

As this is just the beginning of my career, I am eager to learn as much as possible. Moreover, I am constantly seeking opportunities to display my skills while also improving on them. In the past couple of months, I have had the chance to work at FPT Software as a Front End Developer.
