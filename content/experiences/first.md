During my time at FPT Software, I mastered Spring Boot, learnt more about Front End development using JavaScript and HTML, and familiarized myself with datasets management using SQL. Also, I have the chance to participate in the O2 project, which delivers a Medical Insurance Administration Platform for one of the largest Healthcare Services Providers in Singapore.

**Duration**: May 2022 - August 2022
